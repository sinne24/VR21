<!-- Selector exercise


Create a new page, named selectors.html. In this page, 
include (in order), the following divs. All divs should 
have a margin of 1em, and a padding of 0.5em. Do not 
use unline CSS with style attributes on the elements; 
instead use a <style> element in the <head> of the page, 
    and use selectors to set the style properties.

list of your 3 favorite types of food, all in italics.

with your 3 favorite movies, in yellow text.
